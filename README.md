## 1. Nirmatrelvir

Nirmatrelvir is an antiviral medication used to treat COVID-19. It is typically taken in combination with another antiviral drug, ritonavir. 

It works by inhibiting the protease enzyme (M<sup>pro</sup> ) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is essential for the virus to replicate. By blocking this enzyme, nirmatrelvir prevents the virus from multiplying in the body.
